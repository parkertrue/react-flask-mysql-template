"""Rate limits counted in the real Redis, under the app's ACL user.

The ACL lets the app touch only refresh_tokens:* and LIMITS:* keys. If the
limiter wrote anywhere else, Redis would refuse it and the limiter would fall
back to counting in each worker's memory: limits would still seem to work in
a quick test, but every worker would count separately.
