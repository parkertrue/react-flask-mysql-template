# /audit-docs

First read `.claude/skills/_audit-shared/RULES.md` and follow it throughout.
Then read `DECISIONS.md` from the same folder.

**Documents:** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env.prod.example`'s comments, and
the `.claude/skills/` files themselves. Every factual claim the skills make
about the repo is in scope (paths, commands, CI triggers, tool usage, scan
targets), since a wrong claim there makes an audit report a false result.

## 1. Every factual claim

Go through each document line by line. For each concrete claim (a command and
its flags, a file or folder path, a port, an env var, a service, project or
volume name, a version, a limit or number, a test count, a script's
behavior), find the source that proves or disproves it and record the result.
Run commands where it is cheap and safe to do so (`--help`, `config --quiet`,
`ls`). For each command a document gives, ask: does it work **from the
directory it names, with the environment it implies**? (For example, a
`flask` command needs whatever loads the env file that `run_dev.sh` loads.)
Try the ones that need no running services. Pay most attention to the parts
that drift: setup steps, test commands, ports, env var lists, the HTTPS and deployment sections, and the
architecture descriptions of folders.

## 2. The two documents agree

README is for people using the template; CLAUDE.md is for working on it. The
same fact must not differ between them. Flag contradictions, and long passages
duplicated in both, which will drift apart (say which one should hold it).

## 3. Gaps

This is a read-through, not a full run: the commands that start services are
checked on paper, against the scripts and compose files they invoke. Follow
the README as a new user would, top to bottom, without using knowledge from
the code: clone, set up, run dev, run each test suite, build and run
production. Note every step that is missing, out of order, or that only works
with knowledge the document doesn't give. Do the same for an operator: deploy,
renew certificates, back up, upgrade, roll back, rotate secrets, read logs.
Gaps that DECISIONS.md lists as known (no backups yet) are mentioned only if
the README fails to say they are not provided. Also flag any instruction that
has the reader edit a tracked file that CI, tests or another stack also use
(a change for production that breaks the test stack).

## 4. Form

- Writing that only makes sense to the original author (history, personal
  setup, references to past conversations or audits).
- Sections so long a reader will skip them, or that restate the code.
- Broken links: check every URL and relative link resolves (relative links
  against the repo; external ones with a GET request). Many sites answer 403
  to scripts; list those under *Unverified*, not as broken.

## Out of scope
Code comments (`/audit-code`). The "Starting a New App" steps are executed by
`/audit-scaffold`; here, check only that the paths they name exist.

Write the report as RULES.md describes, with ID prefix `DOCS`. Keep the Fix
column short, and add a separate *Edits* table (file:line, current text,
replacement text) holding the exact wording for every finding.
